# Note Taker 
## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to exercise back end development skills using Express.js. 

Using the HTTP methods of GET, POST, and DELETE, I was able to develop an application that saves and deletes users' notes. 

The assignment was also an exercise in modularization, or separation of concerns. 

With the app, users can write, save, and delete important notes as shown below:
